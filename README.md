### Project Objectives

- Automate the login process for SAEC College's login portal using Python, Selenium, and Requests.
- Demonstrate web automation techniques for interacting with dynamic web pages.
- Explore web security and authentication mechanisms to understand potential vulnerabilities.
- Develop practical skills in handling web forms, HTTP requests, and session management.

## ðŸ§° Technical Details

### Dependencies

This project relies on the following technologies and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium: A powerful tool for web automation.
- Requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests.

### How It Works

1. The script sends an HTTP POST request to the SAEC College API endpoint to fetch data.
2. Based on the API response, it extracts relevant information.
3. The automation script uses Selenium to interact with the login page:
   - It enters your SAEC College credentials.
   - Navigates through the portal to perform actions like accessing exam results and personal details.
4. The script ensures secure handling of credentials and automates the logout process when needed.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harish-Srinivas-07/saec-login.git
    ```

2. Run the Python script.

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the SAEC College login portal.

### ðŸ¤– Actions
